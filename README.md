# My web projects
This repository is mainly for me. If you want to stole something (and fix it, all of these projects probably dont really work) go ahead
### http://brainote.wz.cz:8080/
- A web that converts text into a brainrot video with subtitles and a voiceover (the subtitles dont match the voice properly)
- If you want to run this locally you will need to add the background videos yourself into a new folder named "assets", as the videos were too big for github

### http://minotes.unas.cz:8080/
- A web that can convert notes (inbuild limit notes zlodÄ›jina) and text into a minecraft command
- The command can break if the text has some special characters that may mess with it

If you need a web browser, check out freakfox (the best browser ever made), its pinned on my github page
